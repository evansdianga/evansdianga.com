### About myself

I am a software engineer who loves learning and sharing insights with others. Am mostly interested in Distributed Computing, Machine Learning and compilers. I also have interests in medical care, agriculture, sports and motoring among other things. I believe that technology can be used to solve or augment the solving of today's most pressing problems.
